This repository contains code that demonstrates how to manually perform One-Hot Encoding on a text paragraph. 
This is a fundamental step often used in preparing data for training models in Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

# Purpose:
-Learning: Helps in understanding the basics of one-hot encoding and its implementation in Python.
-NLP Preprocessing: Serves as a step towards preparing text data for LSTM or other machine learning models.
